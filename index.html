						You hungry, or thirsty, or a stranger, or naked, or
						sick, or in prison, and did not take care of You?’ Then
						He will answer them, ‘Truly I say to you, to the extent
						that you did not do it to one of the least of these, you
						did not do it to Me.’ These will go away into eternal
						punishment, but the righteous into eternal life.”
